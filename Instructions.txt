Welcome to a Spotify API by Yazaar :)

How to get started:
Follow my guide with images here: https://github.com/Yazaar/Spotify-API

When all one time setups are complete:

If you want to output artists and song in text files:
  Run SpotifyAPI_to_text.exe
  Both text files can be found inside the folder to_text_data, open them up in OBS.

If you want the overlay:
  Run SpotifyAPI.exe (only if first time ever)
  Run SpotifyAPI.html or SpotifyAPI_Slim.html  (open it up in OBS, or in a browser)
  If no music pops up when playing, run SpotifyAPI.exe again. (Try to refresh browser/remove cache first...)

(you might be able to run both at the same time, but not a promise.
 Feel free to try, it will not break the software)

Change advanced settings:

For text files:
  Open "to_text_settings.txt"

  Line 2 is how often you check for a new track and artist in seconds. Feel free to change,
  but too low leads to spotify rejecting you because of too many requests.

  Line 5 is what will be addad at the end of the artist name and at the end of the song name
  (spaces leads to more free space in OBS when using scroll filter on text)

For overlay:
  Edit SpotifyAPI_Slim.html:
    Open dimensions.js

    Edit Width/Height:
      Change OverlayHeight or OverlayWidth to whatever px (pixels) you want
    
    Edit font size:
      Change FontSizeDiff, higher number --> larger track font + smaller artist font
    
    Edit speed of ticker:
      Change PixelsPerSecond (Yeah, the amount of pixels it moves per second. Higher = Faster)


  Edit SpotifyAPI.html (on your own risk):
    Change update data interval:
      find "let LoopMS", you should see "let LoopMS = 2000" and that is how often the overlay updates in milliseconds.
      do not change it to something too low (spotify will reject you if too many requests)
    
    Change colors:
      find "/* COLOR SETTINGS WITH MORE, UPDATES EACH TIME IT'S A NEW TRACK. FEEL FREE TO EDIT IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING */"
      This is really advanced.
